# coral_data_files
A repository to house all coral files?

This repository could house all of the coral data files, used in conjunction with another repository housing ice cores, tree rings, respectively.

74 coral data files as of 4:28pm 2/5/15, All_173 and PAGES 2K S1 coral files complete, moving to other sources...

89 coral data files as of 6:08pm 2/10/15, templating from NCDC archive list.

103 coral data files as of 4:38pm 2/11/15, templating from NCDC archive list.

100 coral data files as of 3:30pm 2/12/15, deleted 6 short files after learning (after hangout) that temporal range needs to be ~50+ years to be considered. About to send email to PI group Re: github repository
